# Lisp Tutorial

This repository contains a Lisp tutorial that demonstrates the creation and display of a record using Lisp.

## Tutorial Overview

The Lisp tutorial provides an example program written in Lisp that creates and displays a record. The program showcases the basic syntax and concepts of Lisp and demonstrates how to define a structure, create a record, and display its information.

## Prerequisites

To run the Lisp program provided in this tutorial, you will need:

- A Lisp interpreter or compiler such as CLISP, SBCL, or Clozure CL installed on your computer.
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Lisp code editing.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Lisp tutorial:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the tutorial files as a ZIP archive.

2. Open your preferred text editor or IDE and navigate to the directory where you saved the tutorial files.

3. Open the `first.lisp` file in your text editor or IDE.

4. Modify the Lisp code or experiment with different inputs if desired.

## Running the Lisp Program

Follow these steps to run the Lisp program using CLISP:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2. Navigate to the directory where the `first.lisp` file is located using the `cd` command.

3. Run the following command to execute the program:

4. CLISP will interpret the Lisp code in `first.lisp` and execute the program. Any output or errors will be displayed in the terminal.
